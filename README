This is a set of scripts designed written to automatically toggle a SOCKS5 proxy between a remote
system and localhost. The reason to do this is if you have a laptop that has location awareness and
you have certain applications configured to use a SOCKS5 proxy on localhost, but you do not wish to 
tunnel all of your traffic through a remote server when you are not in a "monitored" enviroment.

=====
SETUP
=====
1) Export TUNNEL_HOST in you .bash_profile. This will be the remote host to ssh into when the tunnel is
   in "remote" mode.

2) Make sure you you have public/private key authentication to the server configured it step 1.

3) Make a symbolic link to your ssh program from the ssh_tunnel directory. Name this link 'tunnel'
      ln -s /usr/bin/sh tunnel

4) Configure your context switching softare to run ssh_tunnel/start_remote when you enter any context
   where you wish to tunnel you traffic thourgh a remote host.

5) Configure the context switching software to run ssh_tunnel/start_local when you leave any context
   configured in step 4.

I have tested this on Mac OS X 10.5.4 using Marco Polo 2.5 <http://www.symonds.id.au/marcopolo/> for
the context software.
